# CMR-IA: Context-Maintenance and Retrieval Model of Item and Associative Information

CMR-IA is a computational model of memory aiming at providing an mechanistic explanation for behavioral results in recognition (and potentially cued recall) memory test. 

This is a project in the Computational Memory Lab at Upenn. It is developed by Beige Jin. Most code, however, is shamelessly modified from Pazdera & Kahana (2022).

The following is an overview of the data and code included herein:
- /Analysis/: Python and R code used for generating figures, organizing data for analysis, and running statistical tests.
- /Data/: JSON, text, and CSV files containing raw and processed versions of the data from all (included and excluded) participants.
- /Modeling/: The Python/Cython code for the CMR-IA model, particle swarm optimization, and all simulations.

For more detailed documentation, please see the README files located within each subdirectory.

Initially push on 2022/9/20.
